## Explore the world in any time period

[OpenHistoricalMap](https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/) is an ambitious, community-led project to map changes to natural and human geography throughout the world… throughout the ages. Our growing community of volunteer contributors includes amateur and professional historians, [OpenStreetMap](https://github.com/openstreetmap/) and Wikipedia contributors, GIS specialists, and ordinary people knowledgeable about their surroundings. [Learn more about the project](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenHistoricalMap).

This GitHub organization primarily consists of core OpenStreetMap software projects that we’ve forked and modified to accommodate the third dimension of time, along with some homegrown projects to support vector map rendering. Additional OSM projects are built as part of [osm-seed](https://github.com/developmentseed/osm-seed/). [Learn more about OHM software development](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenHistoricalMap/Development).

[Our centralized issue repository](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/issues/issues/) is the first step for any specific bug reports or feature requests you have about the OHM software stack. For discussions about historical research, mapping, or using the data, please visit the [OHM Forum](https://forum.openhistoricalmap.org/), which accepts your openhistoricalmap.org account.
